Hello. My name is Amandeep Kaur. I'm a graduate in B.Com. from India. I also hold a GNIIT certificate.
I am happily married since 3 years and currently living with a 1 year old son in New Delhi.

I am currently working at [Mercer](https://www.mercer.com/){:target="_blank"} in Gurgaon (India) as a senior analyst with a passion for providing services required in commerce business (currently, medical insurance).
My area of interest lies in business studies and accounts.
Besides being interested in work life and studies, I'm also interested in:


* Watching movies
* Travelling
* Playing Badminton
* Listening to Music
* Internet surfing

When I have time and feel to learn new things, concepts and technologies for syncing myself up with current happenings and developments in the world, I do the following:

* [Online courses]({{ site.url_courses_online }})
* [My Reading list]({{ site.url_my_reading_list }})

I am actively preparing to move and work in **Canada**. Little more information about me can be found through [My Resume &rarr;]({{ site.url_resume }}).

#### My detailed resume is available upon [request](mailto:{{ site.email }}?subject=Resume Request).
